# Security Audit Summary

## ✅ Security Issues Addressed

### 1. **Environment Variables Secured**
- ✅ Moved from client-side `REACT_APP_` variables to server-side environment variables
- ✅ Implemented Vercel Serverless Functions for secure authentication
- ✅ Passkey hashes are no longer exposed in browser bundle

### 2. **Sensitive Data in Documentation**
- ✅ Removed exposed passkeys from `README.md`
- ✅ Updated documentation to reference secure environment setup
- ✅ Added proper security notes and instructions

### 3. **Sample Data Removed**
- ✅ **COMPLETED**: All sample data containing real personal information has been completely removed
- ✅ Removed `slack-app/public/sample-data/` directory entirely
- ✅ Removed `loadSampleData()` function from codebase
- ✅ Updated app logic to work without sample data

### 4. **Git Ignore Configuration**
- ✅ Environment files (`.env*`) properly ignored
- ✅ Vercel deployment files (`.vercel`) ignored
- ✅ Sample data directory ignored
- ✅ Build artifacts and dependencies ignored

## 🔒 Current Security Architecture

```
Frontend (React) → API Endpoint (/api/auth) → Serverless Function → Environment Variables
     ↓                    ↓                        ↓                      ↓
Browser Bundle      POST Request            Server-side Validation    Secure Storage
(No secrets)       (Passkey only)          (Hash comparison)         (Vercel Env Vars)
```

## ⚠️ Remaining Considerations

### Sample Data
✅ **RESOLVED**: All sample data has been completely removed from the repository.
- No personal information remains in the codebase
- Application now requires users to upload their own data
- No risk of data leaks from sample files

### Environment Variables
Ensure the required `CLUB_PASSKEY_HASH` and `ADMIN_PASSKEY_HASH` values are set in Vercel. Refer to the private documentation for specific hash values.

## 🛡️ Security Best Practices Implemented

1. **Server-side Authentication**: Secrets never reach the browser
2. **Environment Variable Security**: Proper naming and storage
3. **Git Security**: Sensitive files properly ignored
4. **Documentation Security**: No hardcoded secrets in docs
5. **API Security**: Proper error handling and validation

## 📋 Security Checklist

- [x] Environment variables secured
- [x] Client-side secrets removed
- [x] Documentation cleaned
- [x] Git ignore updated
- [x] API endpoints secured
- [x] Sample data completely removed
- [x] Vercel environment variables configured

## 🔍 Regular Security Maintenance

1. **Environment Variables**: Rotate passkeys periodically
2. **Dependencies**: Keep packages updated
3. **Sample Data**: Ensure no real user data in public repos
4. **Access Control**: Review who has access to Vercel environment variables
